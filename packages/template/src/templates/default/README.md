# Create and Deploy, Part 1: Implementing Logic

## Before We Begin

Here are the steps required to follow this tutorial.

**1. Install Node.js**

> **Tip:** (Skip this step if you already have it installed. Just make sure it's version 18 or later.)

On a Mac with [Homebrew](https://brew.sh):
```
brew install node
```
Otherwise: [download the installer](https://nodejs.org/en) from the official site.

**2. Choose an IDE**

We suggest [WebStorm](https://www.jetbrains.com/webstorm/) (it's the one we're using, free for non-commercial use) or [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com) (free).

**3. Add the Plugin/Extension for Tolk**

JetBrains IDEs (WebStorm, IDEA) [plugin](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/23382-ton) or VS Code [extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ton-core.tolk-vscode).

## Tutorial Goals

In this tutorial, we'll create a simple **counter smart contract**, deploy it to testnet, and increase and query the current total value. The logic will be very basic: it increments a counter by a specified number from an **internal message** and saves the total in its persistent data.

**Internal messages** are those sent between blockchain entities and cannot be sent from off-chain. **Handling these consumes gas** (the blockchain currency paid for transactions, code execution, and storage).

Contracts can also receive **external messages**, which are similar to internal ones but originate from outside the blockchain (e.g., from a wallet app to a wallet smart contract). **Handling external messages also consumes gas.**

A dedicated **get method** will be implemented and explained later in the tutorial: it allows querying the current total. Calling **get methods is free** (meaning no gas is paid), as they don‚Äôt mutate the blockchain state and are handled off-chain (by a TON node with access to the chain state).

You will experience sending messages in the next part of this tutorial, and we'll cover them in greater detail later in the series.

## Basic Concepts

A **smart contract** is a program running on the TON Blockchain via its [TVM](https://docs.ton.org/v3/documentation/tvm/tvm-overview) (TON Virtual Machine). It consists of **code** (TVM instructions) and **data** (persistent state) stored at a specific **address**. It also has a **balance**: some amount of currency used to pay for its existence and computations.

> The address is derived from the initial code and data, so it can be calculated prior to deployment. Moreover, if your code produces the exact same bytecode and data on deployment as another deployed contract, their addresses will be the same. You will most likely encounter this behavior if you don't change any significant parts of this tutorial's code: after deployment, you'll see that your "new" smart contract already has transactions and a non-zero total value.

Smart contracts on TON interact only by sending and receiving **messages** (unlike in EVM-based chains, where calling other contracts can be done during the process of code execution). This pattern is called [Actor](https://docs.ton.org/v3/concepts/dive-into-ton/ton-blockchain/blockchain-of-blockchains#single-actor).

The most important takeaway here is that **there's no way to predict how long it will take a message from one actor (i.e., smart contract) to reach another**, nor **how long it will take for the response to arrive**. However, **the delivery of messages is strictly guaranteed**.

## Creating the Project

We will use [Blueprint](https://github.com/ton-community/blueprint) to simplify and streamline the setup, so open a terminal window (a separate one or in your IDE), navigate to the directory with your TON projects, and run the following command:

```bash
npm create ton@latest
```

This command creates a project from template. Make the following choices: name the project whatever you like (e.g., `my-project`), first contract: `Counter`, and choose the template: `An empty contract (Tolk)`. Your console should look like this:

```bash
? Project name my-project
? First created contract name (PascalCase) Counter
? Choose the project template An empty contract (Tolk)
```

Open the project directory (named `my-project` or whatever name you chose) and take a look at the contents. Depending on the IDE you're using, there may be more or fewer directories, but for now, we'll focus on just one: `contracts`. Navigate to it, and inside you'll see the only file: `counter.tolk`. Open it in the IDE and take a look at the code.

## Reading the Data

The only **function** generated for you by Blueprint will look like this:
```tolk
fun onInternalMessage(myBalance: int, msgValue: int, msgFull: cell, msgBody: slice) {

}
```

> If you're coming from the FunC world, you may be surprised by the absence of the `impure` specifier. In Tolk, all functions are [impure by default](https://docs.ton.org/v3/documentation/smart-contracts/tolk/tolk-vs-func/in-detail). You can explicitly annotate a function as `pure`, and then impure operations are forbidden in its body (exceptions, global modifications, calling non-pure functions, etc.).

As mentioned above, a smart contract has some **code** (functions like this) and **data** (stored in so-called cells). Let's deal with the former first. This particular function (part of your contract's **code**) is the one called when a smart contract is accessed **on-chain** (for example, by another smart contract) by sending a **message**. This type of message is called **internal**, hence the function name. Let's take a closer look at its parameters, especially the last two: `msgFull` and `msgBody`.

- `msgFull` is of type `cell` and **contains the entire message** received by the contract. **Cells are data structures that can hold up to 1023 bits of information and have links to up to 4 other cells.** This allows for creating "trees" of cells, potentially storing as much data as you need. To read data from cells, you need to begin parsing them.
- `msgBody` is a `slice` that **only contains the message body**, excluding flags, addresses, and other header values. **A slice is a representation of a cell that you can read data from.** It reads data bit by bit, and some methods (in particular, the one we will soon use) return the data that has been read and "subtract" it from the slice. This means that when you read data from it later, it will start from the bit following the last one you read. For example, if a slice contains `101110` and you read the first three bits (`101`), it will then contain only the last three bits: `110`.

Your smart contract also has its own storage (**data**): a root cell stored in the so-called `c4` register (potentially having links to more cells if you need to store more than 1023 bits). Let's start by reading the data it consists of.

> üõü **Tip:** If you ever get confused, you can always open the `counter.tolk` file in this tutorial's repository and take a look at the final implementation. The code there is commented in detail, helping you understand what's going on and why.

Add the following line inside the function:
```tolk
var dataSlice = getContractData().beginParse();
```

**`var` means that this variable (`dataSlice`) is *mutable***, i.e., **it can (and will) be changed.** `getContractData()` reads the root cell in `c4` (it's still a `cell` at this point), and `beginParse()` makes it a `slice` we can read from. **This is exactly the reason we declared it as mutable: the slice will be modified as we read data, mutating the variable.**

Now, add the following line of code below the previous one:

```tolk
var total = dataSlice.loadUint(64);
```

**This variable is also mutable, but for a different reason: we will increase it by the value received in the message body.** Calling `loadUint(64)` on the slice we read in the first line makes it process data bit by bit, reading up to **64 bits** (if available) and converting them to an *unsigned integer* (which cannot be negative).

> **64 bits** means the maximum value is **2‚Å∂‚Å¥ - 1**‚Äîa *very, very* large number (**18,446,744,073,709,551,615**). We subtract one since the first possible value is **0**, not **1**.

Finally, we get to reading the value passed in the message body. Add the following line:

```tolk
val toAdd = msgBody.loadUint(16);
```

**`val` here means that the `toAdd` variable is *immutable*, i.e., it will be initialized once and will not change.** `msgBody` is one of the function parameters we discussed above. It has the `slice` type, so we can read from it right away, unlike the contract data (a `cell`). **We expect the body to contain 16 bits of information that we treat as a 16-bit unsigned integer**, so we read it with `loadUint(16)` and assign it to `toAdd`.

> A **16-bit unsigned integer** has a maximum value of **2¬π‚Å∂ - 1 (65,535)**. You can, of course, use more bits (such as **32** or even **64**). The reason for choosing **16 bits** is that it ensures **a very long time before the counter reaches its maximum value**‚Äîa **64-bit unsigned integer** stored in the contract‚Äôs cell, which we read earlier. Later, we‚Äôll write tests to illustrate this concept.

## Increasing the Counter

Your code should look like this at the moment:

```tolk
fun onInternalMessage(myBalance: int, msgValue: int, msgFull: cell, msgBody: slice) {
    var dataSlice = getContractData().beginParse();
    var total = dataSlice.loadUint(64);
    val toAdd = msgBody.loadUint(16);
}
```

We've read all the **data** we need (the current **counter value**, stored in a mutable variable `total`, and the **value to add**, stored in the immutable one‚Äî`toAdd`. Let's **increase the `total` and save it to the contract's persistent storage**. Add the following lines to your existing code:

```tolk
total += toAdd;

var cellBuilder = beginCell();
cellBuilder.storeUint(total, 64);
val finalizedCell = cellBuilder.endCell();
setContractData(finalizedCell);
```

Here's what happens here, step by step:
1. `total` gets **increased by the value of `toAdd`** (you could alternatively write it as `total = total + toAdd`).
2. **A cell builder** is created by calling `var cellBuilder = beginCell()`. `builder` is the third "flavor" of data representation, in addition to `cell` and `slice`. A `cell` **stores data**, a `slice` lets you **read** from it, and a `builder` lets you **create and modify data** that you will later "pack" as a `cell`. We declare it as a `var` because it will be mutated (i.e., some data will be stored in it, as shown in the next step).
3. Calling `cellBuilder.storeUint(total, 64)` **stores the `total` value as 64 bits** in the `builder` (the future `cell`).
4. `val finalizedCell = cellBuilder.endCell()` **"packs" the `builder` data into a `cell`** and declares an immutable variable of type `cell` (this is what you get by calling `endCell` on a `builder`).
5. Finally, `setContractData(finalizedCell)` **saves the data** (a `cell`) from `finalizedCell` into the **contract's storage** (replacing the `cell` from the `c4` register that we read from at the very beginning of the function).

## Checking the Input Data

By now, we have assumed that the internal messages the contract receives will contain valid data in the body (i.e., at least 16 bits of data that we will treat as a 16-bit integer). We can formalize this assumption as an **assertion** and **throw an exception** (i.e., halt the execution and return an error code) if the amount of data is not sufficient to proceed.

> **Remember:** Any code execution on TVM costs **gas** (essentially, money). Thus, **the earlier a faulty computation is interrupted, the less money you** (or the function's caller) **spend**.

Add this line of code at the very beginning of the function, above the line where we begin parsing the contract's data:

```tolk
assert(msgBody.getRemainingBitsCount() >= 16, 9);
```

Here are the details:
- **Declare an `assert` with two arguments**: the condition and the exception code.
- The **condition** is: ‚Äúcount the bits left in the message body and ensure the amount is 16 or more‚Äù (this method doesn't modify the slice).
- The **exception code** is **9**. You can choose any code you like, but it‚Äôs better to stick to conventions. This one can be found in the [TVM Whitepaper](https://ton-blockchain.github.io/docs/tvm.pdf) or the [TVM Exit Codes](https://docs.ton.org/v3/documentation/tvm/tvm-exit-codes) document and means **‚ÄúCell underflow. The read operation from slice primitive tried to read more bits or references than available.‚Äù**

If the condition ("at least 16 bits in the message body") is not satisfied, the code execution stops immediately and an exception with the code 9 is thrown.

> **Remember:** Codes 0 and 1 indicate **successful execution** in TVM!

## Getting the Current Total

The last thing we'll add is a `get` method to check the current value stored in the contract's persistent storage. Add this function below the previous one:

```tolk
get fun total() {
    return getContractData().beginParse().loadUint(64);
}
```

> You can also omit `fun` here: both `get total()` and `get fun total()` [are acceptable](https://docs.ton.org/v3/documentation/smart-contracts/tolk/tolk-vs-func/in-detail).

Note that here we use the same code as in the first function but write it in a single line and return the read value right away. Let's review what happens here:
1. `getContractData()` reads data from the contract's storage (a `cell` at this moment).
2. Calling `beginParse()` on the `cell` makes it a `slice`.
3. Finally, calling `loadUint(64)` on the `slice` reads the first 64 bits and converts them to an unsigned integer which we return.

## The Completed Contract

Here's what your code should look like at this stage:

```tolk
fun onInternalMessage(myBalance: int, msgValue: int, msgFull: cell, msgBody: slice) {
    assert(msgBody.getRemainingBitsCount() >= 16, 9);
    
    var dataSlice = getContractData().beginParse();
    var total = dataSlice.loadUint(64);
    val toAdd = msgBody.loadUint(16);
    total += toAdd;
    
    var cellBuilder = beginCell();
    cellBuilder.storeUint(total, 64);
    val finalizedCell = cellBuilder.endCell();
    setContractData(finalizedCell);
}

get fun total() {
    return getContractData().beginParse().loadUint(64);
}
```

At this point, you can open a terminal window and build your contract:
```bash
npx blueprint build
```

There should be no errors, but you can introduce some yourself to see how they look. For example, you could change `var dataSlice = getContractData().beginParse()` to `val` and see what happens when you build the contract.

> You will get an error pointing out that you're trying to mutate the immutable variable `dataSlice` when reading the unsigned integer in the next line, consequently modifying the slice.
